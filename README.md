Curious about the weather condition in your city? How about the last time it snowed? Better yet, when will it snow in the future?

These questions can be tackled through the continious collection of data over a long period of time, for which insights and predictions can be properly made.

Hence, this project attempts to automate this Extract. Load. Transform. pipeline process using Apache Airflow, Python and AWS EC2 and S3 and the Open Weather API.
